# Moria UB 5.00

This repository contains the VMS Pascal source code for the Moria UB roguelike
game, as developed by Nick B Triantos at the State University of New York at
Buffalo, and released 1988-02-23.

This is a variant of the original Moria game written by Robert Alan Koeneke.

Note that although this version of Moria is called version 5.00, it is NOT
version 5.00 as released by the authors of the program. This program has been
modified by William Palter and Nick B Triantos, to the extent that it can no
longer be considered a Moria 4.8x version. There are various features in this
version that can only be found in this version.

This is also written in VMS Pascal, and is only available for VAX/VMS
systems.  Some of the distinguishing features of this version are:

- A Black Market where one can purchase highly enchanted magic items at 100
  times normal value.
- Monsters on the town level worth negative experience (Mother and Baby, Small Child)
- *Shadow* Balrogs start appearing at level 50 with the *real* Balrog at level
  1200 - this makes it a bit difficult to win.
- New items, and many more new monsters.


Note: sometimes referred to as VMS Moria 5.0 or Moria 5.0. It should not be
confused with Umoria 5.x. This is based on the Moria 4.8 sources.

Apparently there is a Moria UB 5.1 version, but this is not available outside
Univ Buffalo. If you have access to this source code please get in touch!
